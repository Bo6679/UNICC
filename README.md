# 🧠 UNICC AI Media Analysis Tool

This is a Capstone Project for the **Spring 2025 UNICC x NYU MASY** collaboration. The project aims to build an AI-driven media analysis tool that detects xenophobic language, misinformation, and harmful narratives across **text, audio, and video** content.

## 🌐 Project Overview

The tool is designed for journalists and media professionals to ethically report on sensitive topics involving refugees, migrants, and forcibly displaced populations. It supports:
- Multilingual analysis (6 official UN languages)
- Audio transcription and analysis (e.g., podcasts, radio)
- Video analysis (speech + on-screen content)

This repository includes the **integration and UI layer**, combining all core modules into a single user-friendly platform powered by [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/).
